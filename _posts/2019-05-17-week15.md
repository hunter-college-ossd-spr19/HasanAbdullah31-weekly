### freeCodeCamp Pull Requests

I closed my previous pull requests ([here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35976) and [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/36009))
because each of them had multiple file changes (4 and 3, respectively), and I noticed that freeCodeCamp prefers 1 file change per pull request (for some reason, this wasn't
explicitly stated in their contribution guidelines). I then created 7 separate pull requests, one for each of the file changes I had in my previous two pull requests.

### Summary of course-related activity

#### Friday, May 10

We continued project presentations today.

#### Tuesday, May 14

Today was the last class of the semester, and we continued project presentations. I really enjoyed this class because it
taught me a lot more about open source, a subject I always saw and heard being mentioned, but never bothered looking into.

My appreciation for open source has greatly increased, and I am proud to call myself an open source contributor. Some of
the many things that I learned in this class are:
- open source isn't limited to software, it also includes open data like Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap
- different Git/GitHub workflows and techniques, like branching, merging, remotes, issues, and pull requests
- how to navigate an open source project (CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, CODE OF CONDUCT, and README files)
- how to evaluate an open source project (level of activity, level of welcomeness, etc.)
- copyrights, patents, and software licenses, and why they are important to open source
- communities of practice, personalities in open source projects, and computing for social good (e.g. HFOSS)
- **and most importantly**: *anyone* can contribute to open source, no matter their skill level; don't be intimidated by
  the large world of open source, as most of us are regular (read "not geniuses") people who are still learning things as we go
