### Things I can learn to contribute to open source projects

I feel like the things that I need to learn the most to be able to contribute to open source projects are:
- new programming languages/frameworks
- communicating with others who are involved in the projects

Some weak points that I want to strengthen are:
- working on very large projects with many different components
- being patient and taking the time to carefully go through projects

### Summary of course-related activity

#### Friday, February 8

We discussed how to decide whether an open source project is a good match for a person, which involves looking through the
project's website and/or GitHub repository for information about how and what to contribute to the project (usually in a
CONTRIBUTING file). It is also good to look at the community's interactions with the project to see if it is active and
supportive, which will make contributing much easier. We used these guidelines to evaluate a project in class together.

#### Tuesday, February 12

No class.

### Contributions

None this week.
