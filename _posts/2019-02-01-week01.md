The term "open source" may sometimes be confused with the term "free software".
However, they have different definitions as can be seen in the following links:
- <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank">The Open Source Initiative's Open Source Definition</a>
- <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank">The Free Software Foundation's Free Software Definition</a>

Both "open source" and "free software" include in their definitions "access to the source code,"
which is the primary reason some people confuse the two terms. However, there are subtle important
differences between the two definitions.

For software to be considered open source, it must adhere to various distribution criteria, such as:
no restrictions or fees for non-modified redistributions, possible restrictions on modified redistributions,
and no discriminations against persons, groups, fields of endeavor, and products/software.

On the other hand, free software gives the users freedoms such as:
running the program(s) for any purpose, studying and/or changing the program(s), and redistributing copies
or modified versions of the program(s).

The main difference between these two terms is that "free software" gives users the freedom to do whatever
they want with the software, while software that is "open source" does not (although it gets somewhat close).
Whereas free software emphasizes freedom, the criteria for open source are concerned with the licensing of
the source code. For instance, open source software allows for possible restrictions on modified redistributions,
which is a violation of the notion of freedom stressed by free software. Since some open source licenses are too
restrictive, they cannot be considered free software. An example of software that is open source but not free is
an unmodifiable (users can't run modified versions of it) executable whose source code is open source and free.
