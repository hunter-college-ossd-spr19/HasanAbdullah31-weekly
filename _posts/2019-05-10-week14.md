### freeCodeCamp Project Presentation

My team and I worked on our project presentation this week. Overall, I think we all did a good job in contributing to
freeCodeCamp. My future plans for freeCodeCamp are to write all the missing JavaScript String guide articles and then
write guide articles for JavaScript's other standard objects.

### Summary of course-related activity

#### Friday, May 3

I was not able to come to class today due to medical reasons. I looked through the [slide presentation](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/slides/collaborating_workflows.html#1)
on advanced Git workflow and continued the [activity](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/git-collaboration-workflow-activity) from last week.

#### Tuesday, May 7

This week and the following week will be devoted to project presentations by each group. My group (the freeCodeCamp group) will present on Friday, May 10.

### Contributions

I created a new pull request ([here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/36009)) to freeCodeCamp in which I
added details to an existing guide article (the JavaScript `String.indexOf()` article), in addition to adding 2 JavaScript
guide articles that were missing (the JavaScript `String.codePointAt()` and `String.lastIndexOf()` articles).

My other pull request (see [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35976)) is still open.
