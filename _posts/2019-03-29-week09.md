### My understanding of what a community of practice is

It is my understanding that a community of practice is basically a group of people who share a common interest, and these
people communicate and collaborate with one another (and other people) to build something related to that common interest.
This concept plays a big role in many different communities, from park communities to communities in large corporations.

For example, in a community built around an open source project, the community of practice is the group of maintainers,
contributors, and even anyone discussing the project. These people not only communicate and collaborate with one another
on the project, but they also create a lively environment for everyone involved in the project, old and new. Ideally, this
environment is open-minded, friendly, and energetic.

In essence, this "living" environment is even more important than the project itself - it is what moves the project forward.
It allows the project to evolve by generating interest in the project from the open source and other communities (and thus
bringing in more people to the project) and allowing for easy exchange of any and all ideas (which leads to the project's growth).

### My progress with freeCodeCamp

I have carefully looked through the following links to make sure that I understand the freeCodeCamp guidelines on contributing
challenges or articles:
- [Research and write guide articles](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#research-write-and-update-our-guide-articles)
- [Update guide articles](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/how-to-work-on-guide-articles.md)
- [Create, update, and fix bugs in coding challenges](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/how-to-work-on-coding-challenges.md)

### Summary of course-related activity

#### Friday, March 22

We briefly discussed communities of practice and their importance, gave brief project updates, and then worked
collectively as a class to solve an issue in [astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy).
