### My experience with the project evaluation assignment

I think that the project evaluation assignment was very useful, even though it was also very time-consuming
(especially the parts where I had to manually calculate things like number of commits per week). The assignment
taught me how to objectively assess the activity level of a project, by doing things like computing the commit
frequency and analyzing the open issues and pull requests.

Prior to doing this assignment, I've rarely used the tabs other than the "Code" tab (like the "Issues" and "Pull requests" tabs)
on GitHub, and this assignment forced me to do so, making me more proficient at using these other features of GitHub. I also learned
some cool tricks that can be done in GitHub, like changing the end part of a commit history URL to go to that commit number (e.g.
changing *https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/commits/master?after=e5dbe64429c61f3dec2a92a5911e495cbd7d161e+34* to
*https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/commits/master?after=e5dbe64429c61f3dec2a92a5911e495cbd7d161e+17000* goes from
the 34th most recent commit to the 17,000th most recent commit).

### Summary of course-related activity

#### Friday, February 15

We continued the discussion of how to assess a project as a good project to contribute to. Afterwards,
Jessie Contour talked to us through Skype about Open Source NYC and an upcoming meetup.

#### Tuesday, February 19

We continued our discussion on the structure of projects and how to evaluate a project, and then we
talked about our experiences with the project evaluation assignment from last week. We also talked
a bit about how to submit good issues on GitHub (such as the issues we reported on classmates' blogs).
