### Summary of course-related activity

#### Friday, February 22

We had our first quiz today on open source concepts (like the four freedoms) and basic Git commands. We then discussed the Open Source
NYC project and meetup, and finally we started work on a short project evaluation activity (specifically, we each chose a project to work
on in groups of 3 or more people).

#### Tuesday, February 26
