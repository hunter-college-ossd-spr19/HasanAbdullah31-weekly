### My first freeCodeCamp pull request

This week, I made my first pull request (see [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35848)) to freeCodeCamp!
I wrote two guide articles:
- JavaScript String.prototype.toString() method
- JavaScript String.prototype.valueOf() method

The process was actually quite simple:
1. I wrote the articles on my local machine, making sure to follow freeCodeCamp's [style guidelines](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/style-guide-for-guide-articles.md)
2. I pulled from the official freeCodeCamp GitHub repo ([here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)) to avoid merge conflicts
3. I staged and committed my changes (I used a good commit message as described [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/how-to-work-on-guide-articles.md))
4. I pushed my commit to my team's freeCodeCamp fork ([here](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/freeCodeCamp))
5. Finally, I created a pull request on GitHub from the fork (I first had to check some boxes that freeCodeCamp required before submitting the request)

Now, I am planning on writing more guide articles for freeCodeCamp during the upcoming break (I already have my eyes on a few articles that are missing).

**UPDATE:** I closed the first pull request ([here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35848)) due to a messy commit history (my team's fork
had 6 unnecessary commits from merges). I then reset the fork by running the following commands (in order):

<code>
git fetch upstream<br>
git reset --hard upstream/master<br>
git push origin master --force<br>
</code>

Next, I wrote the two articles (I just copied and pasted from what I had before), staged and committed, and pushed to my team's fork.
Lastly, I created a new pull request ([here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35850)) from the fork (again, I checked the boxes before submitting the request).

### Contributions

This week, I made more Wikipedia edits (see my blog post [here](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/HasanAbdullah31-weekly/week10/) for my first edits).
In particular, I made a few edits to the following Wikipedia pages:
- [Illenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illenium) (see revision history [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Illenium&action=history))
- [Crawl Outta Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawl_Outta_Love) (see revision history [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crawl_Outta_Love&action=history))

I added an award that Illenium won to the "Awards and nominations" section of the Illenium page, that was missing before (EMA 2017).
I also made sure to include a proper citation, and formatted the table in the same way as the other table that was already on the page.

On the "Crawl Outta Love" (a song by Illenium) page, I added two citations that were missing (and needed). The first citation was for
the key and tempo of the song, and the second citation was for the chord progression of the song.
